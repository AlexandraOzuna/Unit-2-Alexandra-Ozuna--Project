        <h2>On June 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that made access to an abortion a federal right in the United States. The decision paved the way for individual states to curtail or outright ban abortion rights. It also dismantled 50 years of legal protection for women seeking abortions.</h2>

                <h2>Up until the moment of fetal viability, which is often between 23 and 24 weeks of gestation, or when the abortion is required to safeguard the pregnant woman's life or health, abortion is lawful in California. By 1900, there was an abortion ban in force, and by 1950, having an abortion was a crime.</h2>

                 <h2>The ruling abolished government rules on abortion access that had been established by earlier rulings in the cases of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and it reversed the long-standing constitutional right to abortion. Going forward, in the absence of a federal standard, it will be up to each state to create regulations protecting or limiting abortion.</h2>

Additionally, compared to White infants, Black and NHOPI infants had a 2 different higher mortality rate.</h2>
